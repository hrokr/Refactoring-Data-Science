# Lesson 0 - Your Editor: Choose Wisely But Swiftly!

There are a ton of editors and IDE's out there. They range from old but extremely powerful text editors like vim and emacs to IDE's like PyCharm or Komodo to lighter weight modern text editors like Visual Studio Code or Atom. You need to pick one -- just one for now -- and get good at it. Depending on where on the python learning curve you are, that's not a trivial task. 

You might think you can just dismiss the old text editors but if you ever work on a server, you can pretty much count on it having vi or vim installed. So, fluency in vim might be great, even more so if you add in tmux which would allow you to start up a task, detach it from your machine which could then be used for another task. If you are knowledgable at vim, you can absolutely shred text. Plus it's extensible. With a few add-ons, like vimium, you can cruise the web without needing your mouse. Sooo much faster. Emacs is somewhat similar. The downside is both have a bit of learning curve and the skill is perishable in that if you take some time off, you're likely to forget quite a bit. Plus both are seductive in how customizable they are so you can waste a lot of time tweaking them rather than working on what you truly need to be doing.

With respect to the rest of the text editors and IDEs out there, python tutorials or YouTube videos will not be of much help. I've seen video or written materials that want you to use: Atom, VS Code, IDLE, Jupyter Notebook, Text Mate, Komodo, Python's built in REPL (read-evaluate-print loop), ipython and PyCharm. That's not _everything_ out there but it's close.

Here is what I suggest: either VS Code or PyCharm. VSCode is lighter weight and is backed by Microsoft; PyCharm is more inclusive and can handle bigger projects as well as virtual environments -- and isn't backed by Microsoft. If you think you'll have to bite the bullet at some point and learn at least a little vim (hint: you will) both can use vim keybindings -- or not, your choice. They both have free open source community editions and both have paid pro versions.

But not matter what you pick -- just pick one. After you get good you can change. But there is so much to learn, having fluency in one is going to be very important.

That's true for me too. So, for the rest of this so here we go. If it's a '0' we stick to VS Code; if a '1' we stick with PyCharm.

```python
In [3]: print (random.randint(0,1))
0
```

Ok, VS Code it is.
